Processes, Daemons, and Services:

Show an hierarchy of the system processes:
pstree |less               

List and shows all processes running on the system:
ps aux          
Use the description below as a reference to understand how to read : ps aux :
- USER: List of usernames that started the process.
- PID: The process ID
- %CPU: The percentage of the CPU's processing power that a process is currently using.
- %MEM: The percentage of physical RAM (memory) the process is using.
- VSZ (Virtual Memory Size): Total amount of virtual memory the process has access to.
- RSS (Resident Set Size): The portion of the process's memory that is currently in RAM
- TTY: Mean which terminal device is associated with that process or where was the running processor 
       had started from. This "?", means that the process was started by a background daemon or service.
- STAT: Current status of the process
- COMMAND: Shows the actual command that spawned that running process.

It maybe better to use: ps aux : and pipe it with: grep : so we can filter a specific process:
ps aux  | grep syslog          (For daemon services info)    
ps aux  | grep sshd            (For network service info)
ps aux  | grep crond           (For schedule recurring jobs info)

To monitor processes:
Use the: top : command to shows real-time process information such as CPU, Memory and 
Running usage processes, Load average, and Uptime.
While using : top : command we can sort, filter, or even kill processes:
- q	: Quit top
- h	: Help or show command list
- P	: Sort by CPU usage
- M	: Sort by memory usage
- T	: Sort by time (cumulative CPU time)
- k	: Kill a process (you’ll be prompted for PID)
- r	: Renice (change process priority)
- u	: Filter by user
- 1	: Toggle per-CPU/core usage view
- z	: Toggle color highlight
- Shift + > / <: Scroll right/left through columns

We can install better version of top
sudo zypper install htop       (A more advance interactive UI of top)
sudo zypper install atop       (Has historical data logs and live view)

We can use Batch mode to store top output information and write that information to a file:
top -n 5 -b > /top_info.txt                   (Redirect five iterations of top info to a file)

Stop and start a process.
This will start a process in the background:
gedit &        
ps aux  | grep gedit       (Get the process PID)
List kill options:
kill -l        (If needed)     
kill -15 <PID>   
OR
kill <PID> 
OR
pkill gedit          (Takes the name of the process and kill that process)

Also, there are different ways that the : kill : command can be used giving 
the : kill : command's signal. I have a reference table below:
https://github.com/axruffin2055/Linux-System-Admin-Task-Reference/blob/main/kill%20command%20kill%20signal's%20List


We can manage process priority by changing the nice value. 
Most favorable : -20  and less favorable : 19, 
which mean we can set nice value from -20 to 19.
ps aux  | grep keep_running_script           (Get the PID)
renice 5 <PID>                               (Default for most process is 10; 
                                              therefore nice value 5 is a better value.)

OR

Start a process in the background and change the nice value.
nice --5 ./keep_running_script.sh&
